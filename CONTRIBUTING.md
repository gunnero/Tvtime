# Contributing

MediaHub is currently maintained as a source-visible personal product project. Unsolicited feature pull requests are not assumed to be accepted. Focused bug reports and security reports are welcome through the channels below.

## Before proposing a change

1. Open a concise issue for non-security defects.
2. Use the private process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerabilities.
3. Do not include private user data, provider credentials, copyrighted artwork, operational infrastructure, or generated exports.
4. Keep changes scoped and include tests for behavior changes.
